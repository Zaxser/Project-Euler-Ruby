# Spiral primes

# Problem 58
# Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square 
# spiral with side length 7 is formed.

# 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
# 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
# 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
# 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
# 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
# 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
# 43 44 45 46 47 48 49

# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right 
# diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying 
# along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral 
# with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the 
# side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both 
# diagonals first falls below 10%?

# It looks like Project Euler only excepts odd sizes; a quick look at the
# output reveals that even sizes have much lower prime ratios than odd sizes.

# I refigured this program significantly; I made next to add layer to the 
# spiral instead of having to create an entire spiral object each time, made 
# next go up by twos instead of 1s, made my "primes_up_to" method able to take
# a list of known primes so that it wouldn't need to recreate the prime list
# each time. This made it significantly faster; it doesn't start to get slow
# until somewhere in the 4000s, and even then not truly slow. I think this is
# probably still a bit too slow, but I suspect it'll hit the true answer,
# (somewhere in 20,000s, I think?) before I solve the problem with better
# analysis.

# I streamlined it below as it was breaking into 1400s. It's still too slow.

# This may require some analysis. Obviously, if to get the daigonals, it isn't
# necessary is write the whole thing, just getting the angles starts, with one,
# you add, twos, then you add fours, sixes, etc.
