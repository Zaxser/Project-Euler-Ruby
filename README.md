# Project-Euler-Ruby
Project Euler Solutions in Ruby

Currently solves up to problem 53, with work on problem 54. Each should be
considered a work in progress, as there's an infinite way to optimize and think
about and learn from these problems. I hope their helpful to whoever finds
them.

Since Project Euler was down briefly, I've added some files from "Local Euler,"
at http://kmkeen.com/local-euler/2008-07-16-07-33-00.html, so I can continue to
work on these if it should happen again.

TODO:

Fix input for problem 8

Implement adder for problem 13

Generalize lattice formula in problem 15 for all coordinates
